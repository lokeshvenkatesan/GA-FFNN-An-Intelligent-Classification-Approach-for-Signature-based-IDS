GA-FFNN: An Intelligent Classification Approach for Signature-based IDS
Intrusion Detection System (IDS), the second line of defense mechanism plays a major role in safeguarding the network infrastructure from various threats imposed by the "Black hat" attackers. The ever-advancing nature of cyber-attacks makes the design and development of an efficient IDS, a complex task. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent IDS based on Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for parameter optimization and classification of malicious and normal data. The experiments of GA-FFNN were evaluated on the NSL KDD dataset and the performance of the proposed algorithm has been validated with the performance metrics such as Classification accuracy, Detection rate, and false alarm rate.
